    "# 1. Executive Summary\n",
    "I started this competition by just focusing on getting a good understanding of the dataset. The EDA is detailed and many visualizations are included. This version also includes modeling.\n",
    "- Lasso regressions perfoms best with a cross validation RMSE-score of 0.1121 Given the fact that there is a lot of muticolinearity among the variables, this was expected. Lasso does not select a substantial number of the available variables in its model, as it is supposed to do.\n",
    "- The XGBoost model also performs very well with a cross validation RMSE of 0.1162.\n",
    "- As those two algorithms are very different, averaging predictions is likely to imporve the predictions. As the Lasso cross validated RMSE is better than XGBoost's CV score, I decided to weight the Lasso results double."

    "Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negoriations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.\n",
